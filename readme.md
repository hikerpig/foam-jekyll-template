# Foam Jekyll Template

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your new Foam Workspace!

This is a Jekyll starter template forked from the official [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template).

## Getting started

Replace `baseurl` in `_config.yml` file to your own namespace (if you are going to deploy it to github).

### Start Jekyll locally

```
jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
- [[foam-tips]] - tips to get the most out of your Foam workspace

Notice the autogerated link references below is essential for Jekyll to generate link for currently not yet supported wikilinks.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[foam-tips]: foam-tips "Foam tips"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
